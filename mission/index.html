<h1 id="on-a-mission-to-end-death">On a Mission to End Death</h1>

<p>Death is the great tragedy of life, it limits our dreams, and takes away our loved ones. With the progress of Science and Engineering at the current pace it is reasonable to predict that we may be able to eradicate most illnesses and stop ageing in the next thousand years. If we had an advanced artificial intelligence algorithm however, we might be able to achieve this in the next few decades. This is the number one motivation for me to study these algorithms and try to advance them. Most likely my contributions will be modest, but hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to spread some knowledge and inspiration, so you&rsquo;ll join the mission and help drive humanity forward.</p>
